## toggleMute

### note 
I don't use a MacBook with Touch Bar anymore. So if there are any issues with the Touch Bar, I can't help/debug by myself

### functions
- Single tab/click on the Touch Bar or the Menubar icon will toggle between mute and unmute.
- Right click on the Menubar icon will show the setting for the default unmute volume. 
   - this volume will _always_ be set if you unmute
   - if you change the input volume via the system settings, the app will overwrite it
   - click on the little gear symbol will show the option to set a global _Keyboard Shortcut_, the option for _Autostart_ and a _Quit_ button

### install

#### Homebrew tap

```shell
brew tap satrik/toggleMute
brew install togglemute
```

As this application is not signed you have to do some manual steps:
- open `/Applications` in finder
- right-click `toggleMute.app` and select `open`
- allow the security exception

#### Manually

- download the toggleMute.zip form the [latest](https://github.com/satrik/toggleMute/releases/latest) release
   - alternatively download or clone the repository
- unpack the toggleMute.zip and move toggleMute.app into the Applications folder
- execute (just double click) the `toggleMuteDisableQuarantine.command`
   - if this does not work, you have to execute `xattr -cr /Applications/toggleMute.app` in a terminal
- start the App the first time via right click > open and "Trust me" :wink:
- the Touch Bar button is only visible in the "control strip" and can't be moved to any other place
